Hereâ€™s a rewritten version of your `README.md` in your own wording:

# Project Overview

This project was set up using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Commands

Within the project directory, you can execute the following commands:

### `npm start`

Starts the application in development mode.<br>
Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see it.

Any changes you make will trigger a page reload.<br>
You can also view any linting errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Runs the test suite in interactive watch mode.<br>
Refer to the [testing documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more details.

### `npm run build`

Compiles the app for production, placing the output in the `build` folder.<br>
It optimizes the build for the best performance, including minifying the code and generating hashed filenames.

Once built, your app is ready to be deployed!

For more information on deployment, see [deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Caution: This is a one-way operation! Once you eject, it cannot be undone.**

If you need more control over the build configuration, you can `eject` at any time. This command will copy all configuration files and dependencies (like Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project so you can modify them as needed. All other commands will still work, but they will now use the copied scripts.

You are never required to use `eject`. The default setup is perfectly fine for most small to medium projects, but if you need more customization, the option is available.

## Additional Resources

For more details, you can refer to the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
